Game Mechanics
Movement Mechanics:
• Acceleration: Gradual speed increase for smooth and responsive control.
• Directional Movement: Arrow keys or joystick for left/right movement.
• Platform Interaction: Auto-align character with platforms for seamless navigation.

Level Design
The level design evolves with each progression, offering a steady increase in
difficulty and player engagement. The following specifications highlight how each
level escalates in complexity:
• Distance Progression: Each new level is extended by an additional 50 meters,
making the game progressively more challenging.
• Forward Force Increase: With every new level, the forward force applied to the
character increases by 50, enhancing the speed and intensity of the gameplay.
• Sideways Force Adjustment: The sideways force increases by 2.5f in each level,
providing greater control challenges and requiring more precise navigation.
• Obstacle Complexity: As the levels progress, more dynamic and complex
obstacles are introduced, keeping players on their toes.
• Smooth Transition: Despite the increase in difficulty, the levels are designed to
maintain a balanced flow, allowing players to adjust to the changes while being
challenged.
